The goal here is to create a lightweight i3 package that a someone coming from a desktop environment can easily use without filling it with useles cruft.

Keybindings are mostly i3 default with a few tweaks and the addition of application specific keybindings.

Configs should be renamed before installing into the appropriate folder indicated by the filename suffix. These configs are designed to provide a unified appearance using the colours of the Anarchy Installer logo.

Included apps should be:
LXDM-GTK (display manager)
dmenu (app launcher)
rofi (app launcher and window manager)
scrot (screenshot)
Allacritty (terminal emulator)
Lynx (cli web browser)
Palemoon (gui web browser)
Mutt (cli email client)
Evolution (gui email client)
Ranger (cli file manager)
Nemo (gui file manager)
MOC (cli music player)
Deadbeef (gui music player)
Rtorrent (cli torrent client)
Transmission-GTK (gui torrent client)
Eye of Gnome (gui image viewer)
Nitrogen (gui wallpaper manager)
