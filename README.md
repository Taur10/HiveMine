# Lightweight i3wm desktop

Start by installing the latest an Arch based linux with a light desktop such as Xfce or LXDE or no desktop at all.
Next, cd into the directory you downloaded the scripts to. Finally run the scripts in order from 000 to 250 by typing the
script name if your base uses Bash, or typing bash and then the script name if your base uses ZSH. Higher number scripts
can be run if you feel it will benefit your system.


# Vision

Inspired by Arcos-D, the first example of using a script to replace the desktop with one of my choice (i3), this is my version.
All scripts started as Eric Dubois Arcos-D scripts for i3, but have been reworked by me. Shorter names are easier to type,
the software selection is chosen with an eye towards a medium weight system (and not quite what I would do as this is the
generic version), and AUR installation has been simplified. All software selected should be GTK or CLI to help keep the system
light.

This github will not only install the i3 window manager, but also a basic software package (browser, email, torrent, file
manager and music player), cursors, themes and icons.

Change the scripts to give it a personal touch, hastag out or delete the applications you don't want, copy/paste or type
lines to add the applications you do want. Then simply run the scripts.

Learn, have fun and enjoy.
